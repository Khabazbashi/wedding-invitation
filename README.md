# Wedding Invitation

This project was created for my wedding as a replacement for invitation cards, it was an opportunity for me to learn a bit more about React and how to deploy.

The project is entirely based on React, deployed using Vercel. Key learning moments was general training in React, routing, deployment and connecting to Google Maps services. The site is primarily designed for mobile use.
